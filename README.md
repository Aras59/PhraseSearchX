This project is about seraching phrases in books collection with using Xpath. 

This is app is simple POC (prove of concept). Its base on sslsocket comunication server-client. 
There you can find simple login, register, and reminder password. That datas are stored in XML file. Because of first attempt all resources file like: users.xml and books.xml are not encrypted. In future it will.
App allow to find every sentence you want in books resources. To achive this goal, app use XPath framework. 
As i said this is only console POC. More plans about this app is rework this app on spring framework with JavaFX UI or web UI in react or others technologies.
